learning git and github

Hi github!

Steven Murphy here, 

I am taking the Data Science and Programming Support curriculum at Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, NC. Currently, most of the world is under a quarantine for the COVID-19 virus. I am under a self-quarantine since I worked a concert where someone showing active symptoms decided to endanger 6000 people. No sense in sitting around watching Netflix. I need to stay productive, so I will learn git and github and some other web development languages.
